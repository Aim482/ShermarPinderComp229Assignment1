        <div class="text">This was a website I helped to make in a HTML class as a part of a group project. I assisted in 
            the construction of the home page. Big bites is an official resturant whose permission we had received to use
            their iconography beforehand. The website was well regarded within the class.

            the construction of the aesthetics and some of the coding. Like the previous exapmle this was well also regarded within
            it's class.

            that was due to the inability to gather proper 3D photos to use. The template itself works rather well.
